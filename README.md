### CHECK LIST

The following functionalities were developed:
- LIST RULES: List all house rules
- UPDATE: Editing functionality, i.e. the user clicks on the pencil icon and will then be redirected to a modal where they can edit the rule data
- DELETE: delete the chosen rule
- FILTER: in the search field you can type the rule ID and then click on the magnifying glass in the upper right corner to filter
- RESET THE FILTERS: you can also reset the filters
- Filter without value: if the user does not pass ID and clicks on filter, then
- CREATE RULE: it is possible to create a rule using the "create rule" button and a modal with name and active fields will be displayed

note: regarding the pagination rule I managed to reach a part, but in general all CRUD functionalities are working.
